# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Project is about the stuff I like. It contains four HTML files in total containing one index file (home page) and other three pages for series, podcasts and books respectively.

Home page contains a simple table with list of contents on other pages. Other pages contain cards made by bootstrap.

Each page has a navigation bar also made by bootstrap classes. It collapses on smaller screen with a button to expand. Also each page is reponsive and number of cards on each row adjust automatically.

Currently the details of each show/book is hard coded but in future it can be expanded to populate data from a database.
